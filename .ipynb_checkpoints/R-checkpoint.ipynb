    "16,716 usable survey responses were received from 171 countries and territories. The respondents were found through kaggle email list, discussion forums and social media channels. Questions in the survey consists of required and non-required ones. Survey responses were flagged as \"spam\" if their employment status, which is the first required question, was not answered.
