    "In 2017, Kaggle conducted a [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017) through Kaggle channels with the intention to establish a comprehensive view of the current state of data science and machine learning field.\n",
    "\n",
    "16,716 usable survey responses were received from 171 countries and territories. The respondents were found through kaggle email list, discussion forums and social media channels. Questions in the survey consists of required and non-required ones. Survey responses were flagged as \"spam\" if their employment status, which is the first required question, was not answered. The survey is designed to only asking relevant questions to each respondent. In summary, this was a very well designed survey.\n",

    "- schema.csv: This CSV file includes the survey questions that correspond to each column name in both the multipleChoiceResponses.csv and freeformResponses.csv.\n",
    "- multipleChoiceResponses.csv: Respondents' answers to multiple choice and ranking questions. A single row is the answer from the same respondent.\n",
    "- freeformResponses.csv: Respondents' freeform answers to Kaggle's survey questions. A single row is not the answer from the same respondent.\n",
    "- conversionRates.csv: Currency conversion rates to USD 7.\n",
