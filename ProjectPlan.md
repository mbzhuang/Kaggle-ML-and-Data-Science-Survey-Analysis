1. Project Introduction
1.1 About the survey
	In 2017, Kaggle conducted a survey through Kaggle channels with the intention to establish a comprehensive view of the current state of data science and machine learning field. 
	16,716 usable survey responses were received from 171 countries and territories. The respondents were found through kaggle’s email list, discussion forums and social media channels. Questions in the survey consists of required and non-required ones. Survey responses were flagged as “spam” if their employment status, which is the first required question, was not answered. The survey is designed to only asking relevant questions to each respondent. In summary, this is a well designed survey.

1.2 About the data
The data includes 5 files:
schema.csv: This CSV file includes the survey questions that correspond to each column name in both the multipleChoiceResponses.csv and freeformResponses.csv.
multipleChoiceResponses.csv: Respondents' answers to multiple choice and ranking questions. A single row is the answer from the same respondent.
freeformResponses.csv: Respondents' freeform answers to Kaggle's survey questions. A single row is not the answer from the same respondent.
conversionRates.csv: Currency conversion rates to USD 7.
RespondentTypeREADME.txt: This describes respondent type in the "Asked" column of the schema.csv file.
2. Project Goal
Data scientist has been referred to as the "sexiest job of the 21st century" and "best job of the year 2016" by Harvard Business Review and Glassdoor respectively. The goal of this project is to dive deep into the survey results and get a comprehensive understanding of state of data science and the job itself. This project will inform us what’s happening at the cutting edge of data science across industries and subsequently guide new data scientists breaking into the field.
I will design the analyses in attempt to answer the following questions, which are potentially important information for people in the field.
What hardware and cloud service are being used? Which one is the most popular and what are their advantages over others?
What programming languages do data scientists know? Or do data scientists need to know any language like C++, C##, or Java?
In terms of data analysis, Python or R? Which one is gaining popularity? How about the global distribution of Python and R users.
What software or tools are being used for data visualization?
What do data scientists want to learn? What are the hottest skills?
How is the gender balance among data scientists? Is the balance or imbalance same globally?
3. Research Approach
